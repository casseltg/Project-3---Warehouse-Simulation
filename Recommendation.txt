	Our simulation has found that the optimal number of docks to operate is 2 docks. The amount of traffic projected necessitates at least a pair of docks as a single dock has difficulty processing each truck. 
An increased number of docks allows the processing of more trucks, but becomes riskier as returns diminish beyond 2 docks, and the operation is not profitable beyond 4. A single dock will nearly always be profitable, but lacks the potential for great returns. 
3 or 4 docks have the potential to process many trucks on a high-traffic shift. Between these extremes, a pair of operating docks offers a balance between risk and reward, and is therefore the best choice.
